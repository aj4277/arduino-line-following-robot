Overview

This repository contains the code and necessary resources to build an Arduino-based Line Following Robot. The robot follows a predefined path using infrared (IR) sensors and is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller.

Features

Uses IR sensors to detect and follow a line.

Controlled by an Arduino board.

Motor driver for smooth movement.

Simple and efficient algorithm for path following.

Components Required

Arduino (Uno/Nano/MEGA)

IR sensor module (2 or more)

L298N Motor Driver Module

DC Motors with Wheels

Chassis for the robot

Battery pack (9V or Li-ion)

Jumper wires
